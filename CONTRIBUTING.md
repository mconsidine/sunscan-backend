# Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest in the Sunscan project! This document will guide you through the necessary steps to contribute effectively.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting a Bug

- First, check if the bug has already been reported by reviewing the [existing issues](https://github.com/staros-projects/sunscan-backend/issues).
- If the bug has not been reported, open a new issue and provide as much detail as possible:
  - A clear and concise description of the problem.
  - Steps to reproduce the bug.
  - The version of Python and the project you are using.
  - Any relevant error messages.

### 2. Proposing an Enhancement

- Check the existing issues to see if your idea has already been proposed.
- Open a new issue to discuss your idea before starting to work on it.
- Provide a detailed description of the proposed enhancement.

#### Main Branch Policy

The `main` branch is reserved exclusively for the production-ready version of Sunscan OS.

### 3. Adding New Features

- All major new features must be developed on a dedicated branch, named according to the feature (e.g., `feat-xxxx`).
- Submit your contribution as a **pull request (PR)** for integration into the main branch after passing the required tests.

### 4. Experimental Development

- Major independant changes to the **Sunscan backend** or critical components (e.g., testing a new Raspberry Pi model, operating system, or battery) are considered **experimental**.
- Such contributions must be submitted as PRs on a dedicated branch named `experimental-xxxx` (e.g., `experimental-battery`).
- These developments require thorough testing before integrating them into the core components of the project.

## Current Technical Specifications

Sunscan is currently based on the following:

- **Operating System**: Raspbian OS
- **Recommended Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4B (8 GB) â€” core developments are validated on this board.
  - Any other hardware must be thoroughly tested across the entire system (backend, frontend, hardware), and the documentation must be updated accordingly.
- **Battery**: PiSugar 3 Plus Portable.
